<!--
    For now, remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds.
Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener 
    to the buttons that call your playRound function with the correct 
    playerSelection every time a button is clicked. 
    (you can keep the console.logs for this step)

Add a div for displaying results and 
    change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.

Display the running score, and announce a winner of the 
    game once one player reaches 5 points.

You will likely have to refactor (rework/rewrite) your 
    original code to make it work for this. 
    That’s OK! Reworking old code is an important part of a programmer’s life.

Once you’re all done with your UI and made sure 
    everything’s satisfactory, commit your changes to the rps-ui branch.
